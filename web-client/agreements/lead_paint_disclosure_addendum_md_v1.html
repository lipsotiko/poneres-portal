    <b>Lead Warning Statement</b> Housing built before 1978 may contain lead-based paint. Lead from paint, paint chips,
    and dust can pose health hazards if not taken care of properly. Lead exposure is especially harmful to young
    children and pregnant women. Before renting pre-1978 housing, landlords must disclose the presence of known
    lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards in the dwelling. Tenants must also receive a Federally approved
    pamphlet on lead poisoning prevention.
