        monthly installments of <input name="monthlyRent" type="text" /> Dollars ($<input name="monthlyRentNumber"
          type="text" />), in advance, on the first day of each and every month ("Rent Due Date") of said Term, plus if

        If this Lease commences on a day other than the first day of the month, the amount of Rent to be paid for the
        balance of said first month will be apportioned pro rata; thereafter rent will be paid on the first day of the
        month as aforesaid. Tenant covenants and agrees to pay said Rent as set forth herein. Tenant agrees to pay rent
        to <input name="rentRecipient" type="text" /> at <input name="rentRecipientAddress" type="text" /> (or at such
        other place as Landlord may from time to time designate) without deduction, demand or offset and said obligation
        to pay Rent is independent of any other clause herein. Failure to pay said rent at the time specified will
        constitute default and Landlord may pursue any remedy, whether at law or in equity, afforded under the terms of
        this Lease and/or applicable law. All sums of money or other charges, including payments and/or repairs,
        required to be paid by Tenant to Landlord or to any other person under the terms of this Lease, whether or not
        the same be designated "rent" or "additional rent", will be deemed rent and will be collectible as such.

        <b>PAYMENT OF RENT:</b>
        Tenant agrees to pay the rent when due without any deduction or setoff. If a monthly installment of rent is paid
        more than <input name="dueWithinDays" type="text" />(<input name="dueWithinDaysNumber" type="text" />) days
        after the date when due, Tenant shall pay, as additional rent, a sum equal to 5% of the amount of delinquent
        rent due. If a check is accepted by Landlord from Tenant for rent, it is purely as an accommodation to Tenant.
        If the check is dishonored, Tenant agrees to pay a $<input name="lateFeeNumber" type="text" /> charge to
        Landlord as additional rent. The amount of late fees and bad check fees shall be added to and deemed part of the
        rent due and shall be payable by Tenant to Landlord on demand. Landlord shall have the same remedies for the
        collection of such charges and fees as Landlord has for the non-payment of rent. Tenant is hereby notified that
        all payments will be applied first toward late charges, then toward returned check service charges, then toward
        attorney's fees and finally toward rent. If the remaining amount is not sufficient to cover the full current
        month’s rent, a late fee will be assessed on the current month’s rent. Should the Landlord accept any partial
        payment of rent, this acceptance shall not be interpreted as changing the terms of the Lease which require the
        payment of rent as specified herein.

    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <b>TENANT RESPONSIBLE FOR ADDITIONAL RENT:</b>
        Tenant agrees to pay as additional rent (a) any and all sums which may become due by reason of the failure of
        Tenant to comply with any of the terms and conditions of this Lease; (b) any and all damages, costs and/or
        expenses which the Landlord may suffer or incur by reason of any default under this Lease by Tenant; and (c) any
        and all damages to the Property caused by any act or negligence of Tenant, other residents of the Property, or
        Tenant’s agents, employees, invitees, or family members. In the event Tenant fails to make any such payments,
        then the amount thereof shall be added to and deemed part of the rent due, and Landlord shall have the same
        remedies for the collection of such payments as Landlord has for non-payment of rent under this Lease.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <b>ACTIVE MILITARY DUTY:</b>
        In the event Tenant is a member of the Armed Services and on active duty at the time
        Tenant enters into this Lease, and Tenant subsequently receives a "change of assignment" as defined in Section
        8-212.1 of the Real Property Article, Annotated Code of Maryland, Tenant's liability to pay rent may not exceed:
        (1) any rent or lawful charges then due and payable plus 30 days' rent after written notice and proof of the
        change of assignment is given to the Landlord; and (2) the cost of repairing damage to the premises caused by an
        act or omission of Tenant.

        <b>LEGAL RIGHTS OF LANDLORD:</b>
        If Tenant shall fail to pay the rent or any additional rent as herein provided, or if
        Tenant shall breach any other term, covenant, or condition of this Lease, including, but not limited to, any
        misrepresentation in Tenant's application, Landlord may (a) re-enter the Property and terminate this Lease in
        accordance with the applicable provisions of law; (b) bring summary ejectment proceedings to evict Tenant; or
        (c) pursue any and all other remedies available to Landlord at law or in equity. No such termination of the
        Lease, nor recovery of possession of the Property, however, shall constitute a waiver by Landlord of any
        available action by Landlord against Tenant for unpaid rent or for damages which may be due or sustained prior
        to or subsequent to the termination of this Lease, nor shall such termination extinguish Tenant's obligation to
        pay all rent and other sums due and owing to Landlord prior to or subsequent to such termination and/or recovery
        of possession.

        <b>SECURITY DEPOSIT:</b>
        In accordance with the Annotated Code of Maryland, Real Property Article, Tenant has deposited with Landlord the
        sum of
        <input name="securityDeposit" type="text" /> Dollars ($<input name="securityDepositNumber" type="text" />),
        (“Security Deposit”) receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, which sum does not exceed two (2) months' Rent.
        <b>NOTICE: Total security deposit, including pet deposit, may not exceed two month’s rent.</b>
        The Security Deposit is to be held as collateral security and applied to any rent or unpaid utility bill that
        may remain due and owing at the expiration of this Lease, any extension thereof or holding over period, or
        applied to any damages to the Property in excess of ordinary wear and tear caused by the Tenant, Tenant's
        family, guests, agents, employees, trades people, or pets, or other damages and expenses suffered by Landlord as
        a result of a breach of any covenant or provision of this Lease.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Tenant may not utilize the Security Deposit as rent and must not apply the same as the last month's Rent.</b>
        The Security Deposit will be deposited within thirty (30) days after it has been received and maintained in an
        escrow account, devoted exclusively to security deposits, in a federally insured financial institution which
        does business in the State of Maryland. The Security Deposit may be held in insured certificates of deposit at
        branches of a federally insured financial institution within the State of Maryland or in securities issued by
        the federal government or the State of Maryland. The Landlord must provide the Tenant, within forty-five (45)
        days after the termination of the tenancy by first class mail directed to the last known address of the Tenant,
        a written list of any damages to the Property together with a statement of costs actually incurred. Within
        forty-five (45) days after the termination of the tenancy, Landlord must return the Security Deposit to Tenant
        together with simple interest which will accrue at the legal rate less any damages rightfully withheld. Interest
        will accrue at six (6) month intervals from the day Tenant deposits said collateral security with Landlord,
        provided the said Security Deposit is Fifty Dollars ($50.00) or more. Interest on the Security Deposit shall not
        be compounded. Landlord need not notify Tenant of his/her intention to withhold all or any part of the Security
        Deposit if Tenant has been evicted, or ejected for breach of a condition or covenant of the Lease prior to the
        termination of the tenancy, or if Tenant has abandoned the Property prior to the termination of the tenancy . In
        such event Tenant may make demand for return of the Security Deposit by giving written notice by first class
        mail to Landlord within forty-five (45) days of being evicted or ejected or of abandoning the Property. The
        notice shall specify the Tenant's new address. Landlord, within forty-five (45) days of receipt of said notice,
        shall supply Tenant with a list of damages and costs by first class mail.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tenant's obligations under this Lease may not end when Tenant ceases to occupy the Property. Repairs required
        may be so substantial or of such a nature that work will not be completed within the forty-five (45) day period
        following the termination of the tenancy. In such event, Landlord reserves the right to pursue Tenant for
        reimbursement for costs incurred for damages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tenant has the right to have the Property inspected by Landlord, in the presence of Tenant, for the purpose of
        making a written list of damages to the Property that exist at the commencement of the Tenancy if Tenant so
        requests, in writing, by certified mail, to Landlord within fifteen (15) days of the Tenant's occupancy of the
        Property. Tenant has the right to be present at the time of inspection to determine if any damage has been done
        to the Property if Tenant notifies Landlord by certified mail of Tenant's intention to move, date of moving and
        Tenant's new address. Such notice, from Tenant to Landlord, must be mailed at least 15 days prior to date of
        moving. Upon receipt of notice, Landlord shall notify Tenant by certified mail of the time and date when the
        Property is to be inspected. The inspection date shall occur within five (5) days before or five (5) days after
        the Tenant's stated date of intended moving as designated in Tenant's notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the event of a sale of the Property or the transfer or assignment by Landlord of this Lease, Landlord has the
        obligation to transfer the Security Deposit to the transferee. After the transfer is made and after written
        notice of same is given to Tenant with the name and address of the transferee, Landlord is released from all
        liability for the return of the Security Deposit and Tenant must look solely to the new Landlord for the return
        of his Security Deposit. It is agreed that the foregoing will apply to every transfer or assignment made of the
        Security Deposit to a new Landlord.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the event of any rightful or permitted assignment of this Lease by Tenant to any assignee or sublessee, the
        Security Deposit is deemed to be held by Landlord as a deposit made by the assignee or sublessee and Landlord
        will have no further liability with respect to return of such Security Deposit to the assignor.
      </p>
      <p class="new-page">
        The failure of Landlord to comply with the Security Deposit Law may result in Landlord being liable to Tenant
        for a penalty of up to three (3) times the Security Deposit withheld, plus reasonable attorney's fees. Landlord,
        by Maryland law, shall retain a copy of this receipt for a period of two (2) years following the termination of
        the tenancy, abandonment of the Property, or eviction of the Tenant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Landlord or Landlord's estate but not the managing agent or court appointed receiver shall remain liable to
        Tenant for the maintenance of the Security Deposit as required by law.

        The rental unit you are to occupy or the motor vehicle parking area or separate storage facility you are to use
        (as the case may be) is situated in an area prone to flooding during unusually heavy or prolonged steady periods
        of rain. Such flooding may damage personal belongings and motor vehicles. Because of this possible loss, you may
        be eligible for U.S. Government subsidized flood insurance which may be purchased from some insurance agents.
        Damage to motor vehicles may not be covered by such insurance; therefore, you may also wish to determine whether
        or not you have sufficient motor vehicle insurance to cover loss due to damage to your motor vehicle resulting
        from flooding in this area. The local zoning authority can provide information pertaining to the susceptibility
        of this area to flooding. You may wish to contact the appropriate department before signing either this
        acknowledgement or Lease for this rental unit. Detailed information regarding flood insurance coverage, the
        premiums that are likely to be required to purchase such insurance and any available information about how those

        <b>TENANT RESTRICTED FROM SUBLEASING OR ASSIGNING LEASE:</b>
        Tenant shall not assign this Lease or sublet all or part of the Property without the prior written consent of
        Landlord, which consent may be withheld in the Landlord's sole and absolute discretion. Any assignment or
        subletting without Landlord's prior written consent shall be null and void and of no effect. Landlord may elect
        to accept rent directly from any assignee or subtenant, but the acceptance of rent from an assignee or subtenant
        shall not constitute a release of Tenant from Tenant's liability hereunder. Any consent to a subletting or
        assignment shall not constitute a waiver of the obligation of Tenant to obtain consent for any subsequent
        assignment or subletting, and such consent shall not constitute a release of Tenant from Tenant's liability
        hereunder.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <b>TENANT’S AND LANDLORD’S RIGHTS IF PROPERTY IS DAMAGED:</b>
        If the Property is (a) rendered totally uninhabitable by fire, act of God, or by the acts of rioters or public
        enemies; or (b) if the Property is only partially damaged or destroyed and Landlord, upon notice to Tenant,
        elects not to repair such damage or destruction, the tenancy hereby created shall immediately cease and all rent
        payable under this Lease shall be apportioned to the date of such occurrence. If, however, the Property is only
        partially destroyed or damaged and Landlord elects to repair the damage to the Property, then Landlord shall
        restore the Property to substantially the same condition as existed immediately before such occurrence without
        unreasonable delay. In such event, the rent payable under this Lease shall not be abated and this Lease shall
        remain in full force and effect.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <b>TENANT’S AND LANDLORD’S RIGHTS IF PROPERTY IS TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT:</b>
        If the Property or any part thereof is taken or condemned for a public or quasi-public use, this Lease shall, as
        to the part so taken, terminate as of the date title shall vest in the condemnor. Tenant waives all claims
        against Landlord and condemnor by reason of the complete or partial taking of the Property, and all damages
        awarded as a result of any condemnation, whether for the whole or a part of the Property, shall belong to and
        shall be the sole property of Landlord, whether such damages shall be awarded as compensation for diminution in
        value to the leasehold or to the fee of the Property.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <b>LANDLORD’S RIGHT TO RE-RENT THE PROPERTY:</b>
        If the Property becomes vacant because of the exercise by Landlord of Landlord's remedies under this Lease, or
        should Tenant abandon the Property, Landlord may take possession of and re-let the Property, as agent of Tenant,
        upon such terms and conditions as Landlord shall reasonably determine. Abandonment of leased Property means
        there is an absolute relinquishment of Property by Tenant consisting of act and intention. Tenant, upon demand
        by Landlord, shall pay to Landlord all costs and expenses incurred by Landlord in such re-letting and may be
        liable to Landlord for the difference between the rent payable under this Lease and the amount of the rent
        received upon any such re-letting. Nothing contained in this Lease shall be deemed to impose upon Landlord any
        obligation to show or lease the Property in preference to any other rental property(ies) owned by Landlord.

    </li>
    <li class="new-page">
      <p>
        <b>TENANT AND LANDLORD MAY MEDIATE DISPUTES:</b>
        In the event a dispute between Landlord and Tenant arises out of or from this Lease, Landlord and Tenant
        acknowledge that such dispute may be voluntarily submitted to mediation through the local board/association of
        REALTORS®, the Maryland Association of REALTORS®, or through such other mediator or mediation service as may be
        mutually agreed upon by Tenant and Landlord in writing. Mediation is a process by which the parties attempt to
        resolve a dispute with the assistance of a neutral mediator who is trained to facilitate the resolution of
        disputes. The mediation process requires the voluntary participation by both Tenant and Landlord. The mediator
        has no authority to make an award, to impose a resolution of the dispute upon the parties, or to require the
        parties to continue mediation if either party does not desire to do so. A resolution of a dispute through
        mediation is not binding upon the parties, unless the parties voluntarily enter into a binding written agreement
        resolving the dispute.

        in any one or more instances, or to exercise any election as herein provided, shall not constitute or be
        construed as a waiver by Landlord of such term or condition or an election for future instances.
